# Notes Dump
A few approaches Iâ€™ve found useful so far

- Two pointer approach
    - Remove duplicates
    -
- Three pointer approach
    - LL reversal
- Recursion

    Rotate Array

- Hashmaps to store freq and do O(1) search

    Multiple

- XOR

    To cancel out elements and find out one element in array that is not present twice/once

- Kadane

    Max sub array

- Start with the end of the array

    Merge sorted array inplace

- Preheader for LL

    remove nth node



ðŸ’¡ TODO !!
* Divide and conquer for Max Subarray
* Recursion for Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
* Better approach for reverse bits
