# Leetcode Solutions

Various solution approaches for problems in multiple roadmaps and daily challenges. All solutions are written in GO (golang). Includes the solutions for follow-up questions as well (including time complexity and space complexity)

Working on the following challenges:
1. [Top Interview Questions](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/)
2. [2 Weeks Study Plan to Tackle DS](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/data-structure/?progress=mdc932g)

# Notes Dump
A few approaches Iâ€™ve found useful so far

- Two pointer approach
    - Remove duplicates
    -
- Three pointer approach
    - LL reversal
- Recursion

    Rotate Array

- Hashmaps to store freq and do O(1) search

    Multiple

- XOR

    To cancel out elements and find out one element in array that is not present twice/once

- Kadane

    Max sub array

- Start with the end of the array

    Merge sorted array inplace

- Preheader for LL

    remove nth node

- To find the nearest

    2 ^(floor(Log(n))

    Given number 45, find the nearest 2^x.

    Sol â†’ 2 ^ (floor(Log(45)) = 2 ^ floor(5.49)) = 2 ^ 5 = 32.

    i.e x = 5


ðŸ’¡ TODO !!
* Divide and conquer for Max Subarray
* Recursion for Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
* Better approach for reverse bits
